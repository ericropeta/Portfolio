# Practice with Data Fitting, Regression, and MCMC Implementation

CMSE201 is a course at Michigan State University geared towards the introduction to computational modeling. In this Jupyter Notebook assignment, we practiced using scipy to build a regression model based on the given data. Then, we implemented the MCMC algorithm to estimate the best parameters for our regression model.
