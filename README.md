# Portfolio - Eric Ropeta


Hello! My name is Eric, and I currently reside in East Lansing, MI, where in May 2022, I graduated from Michigan State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computational Mathematics with a concentration in data science and analytics.


This portfolio serves as a compilation of the complete school projects that I've either written myself or contributed to. 


The technologies represented in these projects include Python (via Jupyter Notebook) and R. Included in each project folder is the source file for the project along with a .html copy for ease-of-viewing in a browser.
