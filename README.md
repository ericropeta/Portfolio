# Portfolio - Eric Ropeta


Hello! My name is Eric, and I currently reside in East Lansing, MI, where I attend Michigan State University as a senior. In May 2022, I will be graduating from MSU with a Bachelor of Science in Computational Mathematics, where my focus has been on data science and analytics. 


This portfolio serves as a compilation of the complete school projects that I've either written myself or contributed to. 


The technologies represented in these projects include Python (via Jupyter Notebook) and R. Included in each project folder is the source file for the project along with a .html copy for ease-of-viewing in a browser.
