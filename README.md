## About Me

Hello! My name is Eric, and I'm a 23 year-old student at Michigan State University studying Computational Mathematics with a focus on Data Science and Analytics. I am originally from the Flint, MI area and currently reside in East Lansing, MI. Following my graduation in May 2022, I'm looking to join a team of dedicated people to help them make the most informed, data-driven decisions possible.
