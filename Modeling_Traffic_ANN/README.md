# Modeling Traffic

In this machine-learning-oriented project, I contributed to the construction of an artificial neural network used to predict the most-likely times of day and week in which auto accidents occur.

Unfortunately, the datasets that were used in this project exceeded the 25MB file-size limit for uploading to github. This will cause the .ipynb file to not run properly, as it won't have the required data to load.
