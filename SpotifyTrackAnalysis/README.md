# Analysis of Spotify Track Information

In this individual report, I studied data from a Spotify track database I found on Kaggle.com. Through data transformation and visualization, I sought to find out what metrics are considered when rating a song's valence (the measure of how "happy" a song sounds). 

Unfortunately, the dataset used in the report is bigger than the upload size limit set by GitHub. Because of this, the report would be best viewed via the .html document rather than the .ipynb file.
